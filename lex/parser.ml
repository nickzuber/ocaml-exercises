module Token = Lexer.Token

(* GENERAL NOTES ABOUT STRUCTURE:
 * 
 * The Lexer itself defines an environment
 *  - Maybe here is where the lexer position and process is tracked and handled?
 *  - I've noticed this env is being passed around after each token iteration,
 *    this must be the source of truth for lexing?
 *
